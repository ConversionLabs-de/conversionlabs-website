Experimentation Operating System (XOS) Blueprints help visualize organizational processes in order to optimize how a business delivers an experimentation program.

They have two parts: 1. they are decision support tools that are built on top of and customized, and 2. are connected with some program or business metric such as research velocity, or decision quality, speed, etc.

We present them as downloadable 'tools' (Figma, Miro, Decks, Docs, Sheets) for you to take, customize, and optimize your program with.
